This influx, which began during September 2018, has been progressively increasing at an alarming rate, surpassing all expectations/predictions in May 2019. Most of the new migrant arrivals up to June 2019 were men of Syrian origin. 

However, according to the UNHCR, since the 1st of June 2019, Turkey, following negotiations with the occupied areas ?authorities', introduced a visa requirement for all Syrians who wish to travel to the occupied areas of Cyprus. Therefore, the Syrians are now required to pay for a visa in order to enter the occupied areas of Cyprus from Turkey, which translates to a significant cost, as well as a long waiting period, and a possibility of rejecting their visa request.
 
For this reason, the number of migrants of Syrian origin diminished, while concomitantly the number of migrants of African origin increased. Indeed, according to UNHCR findings, African nationals enter the occupied areas to study in the Universities located there; however, they are tricked about the living conditions and job opportunities, while the recognition of their University degrees is questionable (Maren Wickwire: Manifest Media for Foreign Policy - https://city.sigmalive.com/article/2019/7/24/). Unable to survive and desperate to avoid exploitation, they are fleeing from the occupied areas to the areas controlled by the Government of Cyprus, seeking asylum.

However, due to the sudden change of weather (within 30 to 40 minutes), many herders did not have enough time to save their livestock from the storm. According to current estimates, pover 11,000 sheep units of livestock have perished as a result of the extreme weather condition. The melting of the accumulated snow (up to 30 centimeters) poses a risk of flash loods especially in Sevrei and Tsogttsetsii soums of Umnugovi province."

Entering 2019, DPRK has experienced unusually erratic weather conditions with little precipitation, limiting available soil moisture for growth of winter crops and planting of spring crops, as well as replenishment of irrigation water reservoirs.  The temperatures over the last couple of months have also been higher than normal.  Early spring precipitation has so far not been enough to redress the imbalance, and only very good late spring/early summer rains will do so.  The conditions for soil moisture and irrigation are at an alarming level. The current lack of precipitation and soil moisture will not only affect winter and spring-planted crops, but also the planting of the main crop to be harvested in September. With the current agricultural conditions, millions of people are at risk of malnutrition. Any threat to food security will have a serious effect on an already stressed population in terms of food availability and the risk of increased malnutrition, which will affect the most vulnerable sectors of the affected population:  children, pregnant and lactating women, the elderly, and those with underlying illnesses."

The LPA is forecasted to intensify into a tropical depression as it continues its west-northwest track towards Mindanao land mass. The weather disturbance is expected to enter the Philippine area of responsibility (PAR) between 18 and 19 January and is also expected to bring moderate to heavy rain over north eastern Mindanao and then traverse central Visayas. 

Based on the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model, heavy rainfall (greater than 7.5 mm per hour) is currently expected over Caraga Region (Region XIII), Davao Region (Region XI) and Eastern Visayas (VIII). The weather disturbance is expected to make landfall over the southern part of Davao region and traverse north through Caraga, Eastern Visayas up to Bicol region.

Caraga is particularly vulnerable as these are mountainous areas with river valleys and are susceptible to floods and landslides.  The current landfall is forecasted for Caraga Region,  Surigao del Sur Province located along the northeastern coast of Mindanao. Situated west is the Diwata Mountain Range, isolating the province from the rest of Mindanao. 

Caraga is susceptible to landslides due to its rugged terrain, while the Agusan River Valley (the third largest river basin in the country, with a total drainage area of 11,937 square kilometres and an estimated length of 390 kilometres from its head origin in Compostela Valley) that stretches all the way to Davao, Butuan and Surigao makes the region prone to flash floods. 

As the LPA moves closer, government authorities are likely to pre-emptively evacuate families living near the coast, riverbanks, landslide prone areas and other vulnerable places. The rain from the weather disturbance is expected to cause floods and landslides which is expected to cause casualties and damage to shelter, crops, livestock and livelihoods."

Native to the Americas, FAW was first detected in Central and Western Africa in early 2016 and quickly spread across virtually all of Sub-Saharan Africa. In July 2018, it was confirmed in India in Karnataka state and since then it has been found in seven other States including in Tamil Nadu. (FAO, 24 Jan 2019)

By January of this year, it had spread to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand and China's Yunnan Province. In the case of Sri Lanka, there were reports that up to 40 000 hectares had been infested, damaging some 20 percent of its crops. China is the biggest maize producer in Asia, and second largest producer globally. While economic losses there and in the other Asian countries have not yet been tallied, estimates of economic damage from FAW in Africa ranged from US$ 1-3 billion. In response to the sudden onset of FAW in Asia, FAO is convening a meeting of officials from the affected countries, as well as experts who've been tackling the fallout of FAW in Africa and Latin America - and who have been learning ways to limit the damage.

It has been classified as a Category 5 cyclone (Super typhoon). The typhoon is expected to maintain its strength before landfall. 

According to forecasts, the typhoon will make landfall over Santa Ana municipality in Cagayan province between the evening of 14 September and early morning of 15 September, with Category 4 winds, before making a second landfall over the Babuyan Islands, around 25km north of Luzon landmass. The typhoon will move across the Babuyan channel, on the northern coast of Luzon, sustaining its Category 4 winds for 24 hours. Mangkhut exits PAR by 08H00, 16 September 2018. 

Although the eye of the storm is not likely to traverse through Luzon landmass, the strength and the size of the typhoon (700-900km wide) is expected to cause substantial damage in communities in the provinces of Apayao, Batanes, Ilocos Norte and Cagayan, and in the Babuyan Group of Islands. Around 2 million people (almost 450,000 households) live in these areas. Storm surges of 6 to 7 metres are also expected along the northern coast and across the islands, with the typhoon expected to make landfall on a high tide (more than 1 metre).

Reports of suspected cases of cholera continued in neighboring communities, including Los Bolos, Guayabal and La Descubierta (chief of the municipality). As of 11 August 2018, 65 suspected cases of cholera have been reported (3 confirmed) in Angel Feliz (26), Los Pinos de Edén (34), La Descubierta urban area (6) and Los Bolos (2).
 
There are multiple factors that contribute to an increased risk of acute diarrheal diseases and the spread of cholera in the affected region, including poor hygiene practices, the use of unsafe water sources for drinking and food preparation, lack of access to health services due to the affected area's remote geographical location (it can take up to eight hours to reach the affected area), community resistance to treatment and lack of financial resources for families to access health care.
In addition, the communities in the upper area of the Sierra de Bahoruco's geographic location, which is adjacent to Haiti in the northern section of the Dominican Republic, has been affected by recurrent outbreaks of diarrheal diseases, thus putting the surrounding area at constant risk. The area's high vulnerability can be attributed to the regular passage of large numbers of people between Haiti and the Dominican Republic; this highly mobile population often does not seek care in the Dominican Republic before returning to Haiti (due to cultural and family ties), which could mean that the number of cases in the in the affected area exceeds current estimates."

In some areas, mud levels reached 2.2 metres, which led to the evacuation of 296 people, who are currently being housed in 3 temporary collective centres: Parador Laguna, a local church and a National Roads building. One person has been reported missing.
Tumbaya, located 7 km north of Volcán (48 km from San Salvador de Jujuy) on National Route N? 9, suffered damage from the landslides and severe flooding, where water levels rose as high as 1.20 metres.

The town of Bárcena, with a population of 158 people, is located 10 km south of Volcán (31 km north of San Salvador de Jujuy); this entire area has been affected. A total of 100 people have been evacuated, of which 15 are being housed at Mountain Infantry Regiment (RIM 20) facilities, while others were transported to San Salvador de Jujuy. Due to the suddenness of the landslide, two people lost their lives while travelling through the town along National Route 9.

In regard to the electrical supply, the government estimates that it could be restored back to normal within the next 48 hours in some areas; however, no estimated time has been given for restoring the drinking water supply and sewage services. Local access to health (emergency services, health centres) is practically impossible due to the mud in the streets, as well as to the damage suffered by the physical facilities that provided these services.

FL-2016-000137-ARG,Flood,Argentina,2016-12-25,FL,ARG,2016-000137,"On 25 and 26 December 2016, more than 20 locations in the provinces of Buenos Aires, Córdoba and Santa Fe were affected by intense rainfall which was accompanied by hail and strong electrical activity. The fact that these were low-lying areas, the soil's saturation and the presence of crevices in basins (the most important in Argentina) caused by the constant rainfall throughout the year led to significant flooding and overflows from rivers and streams. The localities affected in this province by this emergency in this period were not affected by the rainy season in 2015 and 2016.
Pergamino, a city in northern Buenos Aires province was one of the most affected by the rainfall, receiving some 220 millimetres of water in 4 hours, causing the Pergamino Stream, its tributaries and effluents, such as Chu Creek, to overflow. This led to flooding throughout the city, which is organized into 24 urban and peri-urban neighbourhoods. The flooding, mainly impacted riverside neighbourhoods (the river cuts across the city) such as 9 de Julio, Cueto, Centenario, Tocha, San Vicente, Kennedy, Centro, 27 de Noviembre, Belgrano, Martín M. de G?emes and José Hernández (the latter three are considered informal settlements); and Jorge Newbery (also an informal settlement) along Chu Creek, affecting 13,650 people, i.e. around 11 per cent of the total population. Basic services such as power, telephony, internet and water were partially interrupted for some 36 hours (completely in affected neighbourhoods), and some stretches of National Routes 8 and 9 (the main access roads to Pergamino) were blocked completely by flooding, making it difficult to mobilize assistance from outside of the city.

More than 3,400 homes have been flooded (between 30 and 220 cm of water), forcing families to leave their homes as access is only possible by boat or some 4-wheel drive vehicles. According to Civil Defence reports, around 50 residents have refused to self-evacuate or be evacuated and remain on the roofs of their homes, and approximately 250 are being housed in four collective centres. At the family / individual level, in addition to some medical emergencies and health complications associated with the emergency (injuries, blood pressure issues, etc.), families have reported the loss of household items (furniture, appliances, household goods, bedding, etc.) and sanitation issues such as garbage, waterlogged structures, vermin, vectors. These issues have been exacerbated by the meteorological conditions that are typical for this time of year, such as mean temperatures above 24? C (with highs above 32? C), high humidity, unstable weather conditions and the pre-existing pollution of the Pergamino Stream.

In addition to partial structural damage to dwellings and some public buildings (Primary Health Care Centres [CAPS] in G?emes and José Hernández neighbourhoods), the blocks adjacent to the Pergamino Stream have large amounts of accumulated debris and waste, which have been hard to remove because of the difficulty in accessing these streets. While the city does have a Local Response Plan, it failed to fully anticipate the storm's effects, catching a great number of families by surprise in their homes. On 25 December, the city formally declared a state alert, including a health alert, due to the level of impact suffered.

In Cordoba Province, the strong storm that hit the area on 26 December caused damage to electrical and water services and forced 100 people to evacuate in Jovita. Twelve homes were damaged by hail, and electrical services were interrupted in La Cumbre and in La Falda due to high winds that damaged lamp posts. Six neighbourhoods suffered damage in Villa Dolores, 50 people had to self-evacuate and there were blocked roads and fallen lamp posts; additionally, the storm interrupted electrical and water services in Villa Giardini, Rio Ceballos, Salsipuedes, Agua de Oro, Jesús María and Colonia Caroya. More than 200 people in Santa Fe Province were forced to evacuate. The cities of Rosario and Alvarez were the most affected, as overflowing channels left half of the city cut off and hindered the evacuation efforts. Provincial authorities reported up to one metre of water in dwellings, including the Volunteer Fire Department facilities, which had to be evacuated as well. The National Society is coordinating state assistance in the form of mattresses, blankets, food, bags and tarps; relevant Ministry of Health agencies are working on site."

During the long rains season between March and May 2016, there was heavy flooding of River Tana, which washed away crops and delayed planting amongst the communities living along the river in Garissa and Tana River, resulting in reduced household level food security and dietary intake. Farming communities in marginal agricultural areas continue to have typically low income due to the recent below average agricultural season.

Areas in the south-east and the coast are the most affected since they received below-average rainfall during the long rains season.

In parts of Kilifi, Garissa, Lamu, Kwale, Taita Taveta, Tana River, Makueni, Kajiado, Narok and Marsabit there are now significant shortages of pasture and water, and in some cases livestock mortality. The food insecurity situation is exacerbated by conflict in some counties, the most serious case in the previous month (September) being along the borders of Isiolo and Garissa where pastoralists' convergence is common.
The prospects for the coming months will be determined by the onset and performance of the short rains season. If the season is below average, as currently forecast, or its onset is late, then the drought situation will become significantly worse, with impacts on health and nutrition, household purchasing power, and security.

A rapid assessment conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) estimates that at least 120,000 people have been severely affected across five districts (Baucau, Covalima, Lautem, Oecusse and Viqueque), with 45.9 per cent of households across the country likely to experience food insecurity from April to June. 

In addition to its effects on food security, the situation has resulted in water shortages and directly affected the livelihoods of thousands of people, especially rural and agriculture-dependent populations. Some communities that are experiencing sporadic rainfall are able to replant short-duration crops (as part of the second cropping period). However, the effects of El Niño are largely affecting communities that are more reliant on livestock and single-season farming. The loss of livestock for many translates to the loss of their ?banked? wealth and will have an impact on the ability of such households to send their children to school and to pay other household expenses. Since livestock is also used for tilling the land, loss in livestock will make it harder for farmers to prepare their land for replanting."

Of the few people who managed to plant their fields, the crops are dying off due to this prolonged dry spell. These conditions have also negatively affected livestock conditions due to poor pastures and limited  availability of water. 

The prolonged dry spells and drought not only affected maize production but other crops such as sorghum, beans, peas and wheat have also been affected, and harvests are down and low yields are therefore expected. The drought situation resulted in a 51% cereal deficit of the required 247,000 metric tonnes. Out of 10 districts the 5 hard to reach districts in Lesotho are the most affected including Qacha's Nek, Mokhotlong, Thaba Tseka, Quthing and Mafeteng."

during election periods. An agreement on a repatriation mechanisms protocol was signed in 1999 between the
Dominican Republic and Haiti; however, it was never implemented. A review of this protocol has been requested by
the Haitian government.
In the current environment, it is imperative that steps be considered in order to manage all cases that correspond to
the three categories of people identified as migrants and their descendants under Dominican law as:
- Group A: People born to foreign parents in the Dominican Republic and recorded in the civil status registries
and members of their families;
- Group B: Those born in the Dominican Republic, but who have never been recorded in the civil status
registries;
There is a third category, which consists of economic migrants in irregular situations:
- Group C: Immigrants in the Dominican Republic in irregular situations (mostly Haitian) are estimated at over
300,000 people, with around 250,000 who do not have documentation.
Currently, there are operations to deport irregular migrants operations (from 500 to 1,000 per week according to
information gathered from civil society organizations present at the border), and the deportations are mostly outside of
any established repatriation mechanism between the two countries. According to the reports, in addition to the four
official border crossings, hundreds of illegal crossing points are used, making the process of identification and the
provision of assistance to affected populations very difficult.
The Haitian government considers the risks associated with mass deportations as high, with the possibility of
spontaneous movements of population on both sides of the border, accompanied by acts of violence or riots."

Three events of this same type were registered on the same day at 10:52, 13:38 and 14:50 local time, the latter being the most intense.

As a result of these eruptions and due to wind conditions prevailing in the Central Valley area, a dispersion cloud formed covering most of the northern Central Valley sector. The cloud caused the interruption of operations for over 24 hours at the Juan Santamaría International Airport.  

This situation caused alarm among the population in the affected areas given that the Turrialba Volcano has been active since 2001 with increased activity since 2010.  This is the first time that ash has rained down with this intensity.

The National Risk Prevention and Emergency Care Commission (C.N.E. for its Spanish acronym) alerted the Technical Advisory Committee on Volcanology to conduct the relevant scientific studies around the situation so that first responder institutions and other government agencies could have the necessary data for appropriate decision-making.

The situation was the most critical in the municipality of Lu?ani and Kur?umlija. In Lu?ani, around 50 families were endangered by the increasing levels of river Bjelica, and one of the roads leading to Lu?ani was disconnected because of floods. On 19 April conditions got worse and an emergency situation has been declared in a few municipalities as the river levels grew above the normal defense levels.

This is a 32% increase compared with the immediate previous year. A total of 319,244 metric tonnes will be required to cover the cereal deficit that the country is facing. 

The figures documented by the ZIMVAC assessment are primarily rural households and do not include the urban households. As has become a trend in food insecurity, the severely affected provinces in terms of percentage of food insecure population are; Matebeleland North (40%), Matebeleland South (32%), Masvingo (32%) and Midlands (30%). Post-harvest losses account to 20-30% of grain losses. Below is a table highlighting the most affected provinces and districts.

Late onset of rainfall, pro-longed dry spells and erratic rainfall coupled with limited access to inputs account for the poor performance of the 2012/13 agricultural season. The ZIMVAC report also notes that levels of child severe acute malnutrition exceed the globally accepted rates (4.7% compared to  the global rate of 2%).  Zimbabwe Red Cross has decided to target Gwanda district which has a population of 112,267.

The country?s Independent Electoral Commission had declared the opposition candidate Alassane Ouatarra the winner of the run off on 2 December 2010 but was overturned by the country?s Constitutional Council which announced the incumbent President Gbagbo the winner though the international community including the UN recognized the victory of the opposition candidate. Since the two opposing candidates have taken oaths of office in different locations on 4 December 2010 and forming parallel governments in C?te d?Ivoire, there have been protests in the country even before and after the presidential election run-off. The situation has affected movement of people and goods within the country thereby leading to increase in cost of living as prices of food ingredients have soared. The fear of violence has also led to the movement of some people into neighbouring Liberia and Guinea Conakry. An estimated 4,000 people had entered Liberia with new arrivals reported in villages along the border at a rate now of around 150 people per day. Meanwhile in Guinea, the number of newly registered Ivorian refugees in the southeast of the country is stable at some 186 people. As the political solution is being sought to the stalemate, there is the fear of increased population movement from C?te d?Ivoire into Guinea, Liberia as well as Burkina Faso, Ghana and Mali to some extent in the coming days and this may lead to humanitarian needs in these countries."

The second case is under treatment and close monitoring. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the disease was confirmed by laboratory diagnosis on 30 July 2007. There is fear of at least 47 suspected cases in Kampala as a result of secondary transmission/contact from the first infected person who traveled to Kampala where he was being treated before his death. There are further fears of the potential spread of the disease in Kayunga district since some gold miners from Kitaka traveled back to their homes in Kayunga.

Delayed rains resulted in abnormal pastoral migration patterns and a further depletion of already exhausted pasture and browse in all grazing areas.  The rain has also been insufficient to replenish much-needed water sources throughout the country and it is below the threshold for pasture regeneration.  All water catchments in the south are practically dry. 

The food security and livelihoods of 5,000 families (28,650 people) have been severely compromised by limited water and pasture.  Significant over-grazing of pasture and the depletion of water sources have contributed to widespread livestock deaths and a considerable decline in milk productivity.

VO-1980-000002-USA,Volcano,United States,1980-05-18,VO,USA,1980-000002,"The May 18, 1980, eruption was the most destructive in the history of the United States. Novarupta (Katmai) Volcano, Alaska, erupted considerably more material in 1912, but owing to the isolation and sparse population of the region affected, there were no human deaths and little property damage. In contrast, Mount St. Helens' eruption in a matter of hours caused loss of lives and widespread destruction of valuable property, primarily by the debris avalanche, the lateral blast, and the mudflows.

Landscape changes caused by the May 18 eruption were readily seen on high-altitude photographs. Such images, however, cannot reveal the impacts of the devastation on people and their works. The May 18 eruption resulted in scores of injuries and the loss of 57 lives. Within the United States before May 18, 1980, only two known casualties had been attributed to volcanic activity - a photographer was struck by falling rocks during the explosive eruption of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, in 1924; and an Army sergeant who disappeared during the 1944 eruption of Cleveland Volcano, Chuginadak Island, Aleutians. Autopsies indicated that most of Mount St. Helens' victims died by asphyxiation from inhaling hot volcanic ash, and some by thermal and other injuries.  Accurate cost figures remain difficult to determine. Early estimates were too high and ranged from $2 to $3 billion, primarily reflecting the timber, civil works, and agricultural losses. A refined estimate of $1.1 billion was determined in a study by the International Trade Commission at the request of Congress. A supplemental appropriation of $951 million for disaster relief was voted by Congress, of which the largest share went to the Small Business Administration, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency."

It rapidly intensified and by the time it reached western Cuba the next day it was a Category 3 hurricane. Camille tracked north-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico and became a Category 5 hurricane on August 16. The hurricane maintained this intensity until it made landfall along the Mississippi coast late on the 17th. Camille weakened to a tropical depression as it crossed Mississippi into western Tennessee and Kentucky, then it turned eastward across West Virginia and Virginia. The cyclone moved into the Atlantic on August 20 and regained tropical storm strength before becoming extratropical on the 22nd. A minimum pressure of 26.84 inches was reported in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, which makes Camille the second most intense hurricane of record to hit the United States. The actual maximum sustained winds will never be known, as the hurricane destroyed all the wind-recording instruments in the landfall area. The estimates at the coast are near 200 mph. Columbia, Mississippi, located 75 miles inland, reported 120 mph sustained winds. A storm tide of 24.6 ft occurred at Pass Christian, Mississippi. The heaviest rains along the Gulf Coast were about 10 inches. However, as Camille passed over the Virginias, it produced a burst of 12 to 20 inch rains with local totals of up to 31 inches. Most of this rain occurred in 3 to 5 hours and caused catastrophic flash flooding. The combination of winds, surges, and rainfalls caused 256 deaths (143 on the Gulf Coast and 113 in the Virginia floods) and $1.421 billion in damage."
